    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms
    and set out walking once more.
    <span class="underline">
      I felt so deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was
      carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span class="highlight">
      It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on Earth.</span>
    In the moonlight, I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,
    his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span class="important">
      "What if I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again:
    <span class="important">
      "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
      here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines
      through his whole being like a flame of a lamp, even when he is
      asleep..."</span>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <span class="underline">
      I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
      that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
